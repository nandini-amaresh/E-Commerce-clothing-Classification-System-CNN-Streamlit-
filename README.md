# E-Commerce-clothing-Classification-System-CNN-Streamlit-
AI-based clothing classification system for e-commerce using deep learning (MobileNetV2). Supports single-image prediction and batch catalog organization with a Streamlit dashboard.
This project presents an AI-based clothing classification system for e-commerce platforms using deep learning and computer vision. The system automatically classifies clothing images into product categories and organizes catalogues efficiently.
Manual product classification is time-consuming and inconsistent for large online stores. This project solves that problem using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on the DeepFashion dataset to automate product categorization.
The system supports both single-image classification and batch processing for large-scale e-commerce catalogues.
